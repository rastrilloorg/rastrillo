/* shell.js — phone navigation for the sidebar and console shells.
   First-party, dependency-free, CSP-clean, and optional: delete it (and
   its <script> tag) and every page still works, because the index and
   the back control are ordinary server-rendered pages and links. It is
   app-owned from the moment it is scaffolded.

   What it reads, all written by the layouts, in either spelling:
     [rst-shell-sidebar~="index"|"page"], [rst-shell-console~=…]
                           which view the server rendered (the "view"
                           block): .rst-shell-sidebar--index and so on
     [rst-shell-back] a    the back control; its href is the "up" block
     [rst-shell-nav] a     the index's rows

   What it adds, three things:
   1. Direction. In pagereveal it types the view transition "back" or
      "forward", which shell.css turns into a slide.
   2. Back reuses history. A plain click on the back control calls
      history.back() when, and only when, the Navigation API proves the
      entry behind this one is the up page, in another document; the
      index then comes back from the back/forward cache as it was left.
   3. Focus returns to the section you left. Leaving a content page
      records its path in sessionStorage; revealing the index at phone
      width focuses the nav link to that path, or else the one the URL's
      #fragment names.

   The layouts load it with blocking="render": the direction is set in
   pagereveal, at the first render, and a deferred script can run after
   it. An engine that ignores blocking gets an untyped transition, which
   shell.css draws as a cross-fade. */
