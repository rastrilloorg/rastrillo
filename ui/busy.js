/* busy.js — the busy rule. First-party, dependency-free, and on by
   default: link it and every submit button in every form that goes
   somewhere is covered, with no attribute to remember, because a button
   that changes something should say so while it works, and a form that
   double-submits on a second click is a bug on every screen. It is
   app-owned from the moment it is vendored; leave it unlinked to opt the
   whole app out.

   What a submitted button does: its label gives way to a spinner (the
   label stays, beside the spinner, under reduced motion or forced
   colours — tokens.css), it goes aria-busy and then disabled, and its
   form refuses a second submit. The spinner shows for at least
   HOLD_MS: a response faster than that is held back until then, so a
   quick save reads as a deliberate beat rather than a flicker. Going
   Back to the page hands every busy form back, and a submit still being
   held when the page is left is dropped rather than sent later.

   Vocabulary:
     data-busy="false"     on a <form> or on one submit button: opt OUT
                           of the busy rule. The rule is the default, so
                           any other value — data-busy on its own
                           included — changes nothing
     data-busy-label="…"   on the form or on the button: replacement
                           button text while it works

   A script that handles a submit itself (a fetch, say) cancels it in a
   listener on the form or the document, as it would anyway: those run
   before this file's window listener, which then sees the cancelled
   submit and leaves it — and its feedback — to that script. Two edges
   of the hold, on purpose: a handler that stops the submit event's
   propagation keeps it from the window, so that submit goes at once,
   unheld; and a form removed from the page during the hold (a polled
   fragment replacing it) takes its held submit with it. */

  // ── The busy rule ────────────────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // A button that CHANGES something says so while it works; a button
  // that only reveals something — a disclosure, a dropdown, a tab —
  // does not. So every submit button in every form is covered by
  // default, with no attribute to remember: the submitted button gets
  // aria-busy, a spinner and — once the submission is under way —
  // disabled, and its form gets aria-busy and a guard against a second
  // submit. The data-busy vocabulary above opts out of either half.
  //
  // The guard is the substance, the spinner is the manners, and neither
  // is a promise: with scripts off the form submits exactly as it
  // always did, twice if the visitor clicks twice. Idempotency stays
  // the server's job. One delegated capture-phase listener, for the
  // reasons light dismiss gives below: fragments, and never double-bind.
  //
  // Two traps this shape exists to avoid:
  //
  //   - A form the browser REFUSED must not sit there looking busy.
  //     Constraint validation fails before the submit event is fired at
  //     all, so an invalid form never reaches this code; a cancelled
  //     one is handed back in the tick below. (formnovalidate skips
  //     validation and really does submit, which should look like it.)
  //   - Nothing that could change the payload happens while the payload
  //     is being read. The entry list is built before submit fires, but
  //     engines have differed, so aria-busy, the spinner and a
  //     <button>'s TEXT (never submitted — a button submits its value
  //     attribute) go on synchronously, while disabled and an
  //     <input type="submit">'s value (which IS what it submits) wait.
  //
  // Every busy element in the DOCUMENT, then the ownership test: a
  // form="id" submit button is owned by a form it does not live in.
