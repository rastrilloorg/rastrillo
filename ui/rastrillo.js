/* rastrillo.js — the fragment shim. First-party, dependency-free, and
   almost entirely inert: the polling section answers only to an opt-in
   data attribute, and everything it enhances also works with scripts
   disabled (a status page's <noscript> meta refresh). This file is
   app-owned from the moment it is scaffolded — edit it like any other
   static file.

   One section is on by default instead, because it has no per-instance
   decision to make: light dismiss for the menu idioms, keyed off the
   rst-dropdown / rst-row-menu attributes — a menu that closes on an
   outside click on one screen and not the next is worse than either
   rule applied everywhere. Delete it to opt the whole app out.

   The busy rule, which used to live here too, is busy.js: link it and
   every submit button in every form is covered; leave it out and none
   is.

   Vocabulary:
     data-poll="URL"       fetch URL for an HTML fragment, replace this
                           element with it, and keep going only if the
                           replacement element itself carries data-poll
     data-poll-every="2"   seconds between polls (default 2)
     data-poll-push="URL"  optional, beside data-poll: open an
                           EventSource to URL and re-fetch the fragment
                           when the server says so, instead of on a
                           timer. Any EventSource error downgrades this
                           element to timer polling for good (once,
                           no flapping); a browser without EventSource
                           never leaves the timer path

   select.js is a sibling file following exactly these rules, kept
   separate so this one stays small enough to read in one sitting. It
   answers data-rst-select on a <select>, which field-select emits past
   ten options.

   Every poll carries the request header Rastrillo-Fragment: 1, which
   marks the request as a shim poll so a handler can tell it apart from
   direct navigation. Reserved: the framework's own handlers do not
   read it today.

   Menus: an open <details rst-dropdown>, <details rst-row-menu>, a
   nested <details rst-menu-group>, or the topbar's and console's narrow
   <details rst-shell-menu> card (whose content is its next sibling, the
   tail) closes on an outside click and on Escape, in EITHER spelling,
   so upgrading this file before running `rastrillo markup` leaves no
   dead menus. Exclusivity stays native.

   A polled response may answer 204 with a Rastrillo-Location header
   instead of a fragment; the shim navigates there, but only to a local
   path. 403 and 404 end the poll for good — the job was swept, or was
   never yours. Any other fetch error backs off (doubling to a 30s cap)
   and keeps trying — a network blip must not strand a status page. */

  // Light dismiss — the one behaviour the native disclosure genuinely
  // cannot do, which is the shim's whole admission rule. A <details>
  // menu closes on a second click of its own summary and on nothing
  // else: not on a click elsewhere on the page, not on Escape. Both are
  // what every menu anywhere else does, and neither is expressible in
  // HTML or CSS.
  //
  // Two delegated listeners on the document, never one per element, so a
  // dropdown that arrives inside a polled fragment is covered the moment
  // it lands and re-scanning can never double-bind. Capture phase, so a
  // page whose own handler stops propagation cannot leave a menu stuck
  // open.
  //
  // The scriptless baseline is untouched: with this file removed, the
  // menus still toggle and the native <details name> group still keeps
  // one open at a time.
  //
  // The nested rst-menu-group is in MENUS even though it is never in the
  // <details name> group with its parent — the two mechanisms answer
  // different questions. The name group decides which menus may be open
  // at once, and a submenu must be exempt from it or opening one would
  // close the menu around it. Dismissal is not exclusivity: a submenu
  // left open behind its closing parent is still open the next time the
  // parent opens, which is a menu remembering a state the user has no
  // way to see. Listing it here also gives the natural behaviour of
  // clicking elsewhere INSIDE the parent closing the submenu — the
  // contains(except) test below already draws that line for free.
  //
  // The old sidebar drawer and the toggle-block are deliberately absent
  // from MENUS: neither is a menu, and closing one because a click
  // landed elsewhere would fight the user. The topbar's and console's
  // narrow Menu IS in, since it became a floating card: an overlay, which
  // is what this list is for. It is not in the rst-menus name group,
  // which is document-wide; there, opening the account menu inside the
