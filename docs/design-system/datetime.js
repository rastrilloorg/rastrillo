/* datetime.js — the natural-language date combobox. A sibling of
   rastrillo.js and select.js, on exactly the same terms: first-party,
   dependency-free, inert by default, and app-owned from the moment
   rastrillo new writes it into static/.

   Type "tomorrow", "next fri 9am", "25 Dec 6pm", "in 2 weeks" or
   "14:30" and the combobox resolves it, previews the reading, and
   writes it back to the native input on commit. The native input never
   leaves the DOM: it keeps its name and its wire value, so every POST
   is byte-identical to the un-enhanced form and the server keeps
   parsing it with the same code. With scripts off the field is an
   ordinary <input type="date">, and the browser's own picker still
   opens.

   Vocabulary:
     data-rst-date               on a date or datetime-local input: arm
                                 the combobox
     data-rst-time               the same, on a time input — the script
                                 reads a clock rather than a calendar
     data-rst-date-words         the parser vocabulary, one JSON object
                                 of |-separated spellings (see
                                 ui/funcs.go's dateWords)
     data-rst-date-set           the commit affordance's label
     data-rst-date-hint          guidance under the list, {example}
                                 substituted here with a date this
                                 locale's own formatter wrote
     data-rst-date-pick          label for the native-picker button
     data-rst-date-results       live-region text, {n} substituted
     data-rst-date-result-one    live-region text for exactly one
     data-rst-date-quick-*       the seven quick-pick labels: today,
                                 tomorrow, next-week, plus-1h, plus-2h,
                                 end-of-day, next-day
     data-rst-range              on a WRAPPER around two armed inputs:
                                 the two pair up by DOM order (first is
                                 the start, second the end). The end
                                 gets quick picks relative to the
                                 start. A value of "session" also seeds
                                 an empty end to start + 1h when the
                                 start is committed.

   ui/partials/field-date.html, field-time.html, field-datetime.html
   and field-daterange.html emit all of it. Every string comes from the
   framework's base catalog (rastrillo.ui.date_*) and rides out on
   attributes, because this markup is built in the browser where the
   catalog is out of reach — so this file carries no English
   VOCABULARY: not one word the parser matches on is written here. It
   does carry English fallbacks for the eleven labels it puts on
   screen, exactly as select.js does, so the file still works standing
   alone in a page that forgot an attribute.

   The parser is a pure function of (text, vocabulary, locale tables,
   now). It knows no month names and no weekday names by heart: it asks
   Intl for them, in the page's own language, and folds the digits the
   same way, so a field enhanced in Hindi reads Devanagari digits and
   Hindi month names without a table anyone has to maintain. The
   vocabulary — "tomorrow", "next", "in", "ago" — is the half a machine
   cannot derive, and that half arrives translated on the attribute.

   The pure half is exported for Node at the bottom of the file, behind
   a guard a browser never takes; ui/datetime_node.mjs drives it
   against ui/testdata/datetime/*.json. */
